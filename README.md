# simple_automations
This repo contains a few Python and Bash script files where I wrote some codes that automates some of my repititive daily tasks. Tasks like 
git operations (git add, commit, push and pull), creating programing files (creating a file with options to choose the language file type, then inserts the needed header files into the file, make the file executable and keep it open in my prefered editor(vim)). Also automated loging into mysql server; the SQL login script checks if MYSQL server
is currently running, if it is not running, it starts the server and then request user credentials for login. 
  
Feel free to use any of these scripts and improve it according to your own need or add more functionalities to it!
